# portfolio-practice

## Description

I created this portfolio to practice css flexbox and basic animations. The tough parts of this project was
was flexbox alignment, as well as alignment of main after the media query.

I worked to use media queries, percentages, and viewport to keep the website responsive.

In future sites I plan to implement css variables for easier color management. I also believe there are further improvements that can be made to the navbar and card scaling.

After this project I'm feeling much more comfortable with flexbox, and will be able to create higher quality and better scaling layouts as I continue to practice.
